# On-Deploy Scripts Framework by Bounteous (previously HS2 Solutions)

This is a framework developed by Bounteous to allow developers to create and leverage one-time scripts that run
on an AEM server upon deploy of a code bundle.

This feature is now offically part of
[ACS AEM Commons](https://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-commons/features/on-deploy-scripts/index.html).
