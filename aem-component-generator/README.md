# aem-component-generator

AEM component generator is a Java project that enables developers to automatically create the base structure of an
AEM component using a JSON configuration file specifying component and dialog properties and other configuration
options.

## Installation

AEM component generator can be either downloaded as a .jar file or cloned from the bitbucket project and built locally
with following command which will create an executable jar file under the `target` folder.

```sh
$ mvn clean install
```

## How To Use

Step 1: Copy your `component-generator-N.N.jar` file to the your `hs2-aem-base` project under the `scripts/compgen`
folder.

Step 2: Copy the `data-config.json` file from this project to the same folder and update with relevant configs for your component.

- `project-settings`: contains configuration options related to the project code will be generated for
- `project-settings.bundle-path`: path to the code bundle's root of Java packages
- `project-settings.apps-path`: path to the apps root
- `project-settings.component-path`: path to the project's components directory
- `project-settings.model-interface-pkg`: Java package for the interface model objects
- `project-settings.model-impl-pkg`: Java package for the implementation model objects
- `name`: folder name for the component
- `title`: human readable component name, also used as the title for dialogs
- `group`: component group
- `type`: component folder type - content, form, structure
- `options.js`: whether to create an empty JS lib for the component (shared with CSS lib)
- `options.css`: whether to create an empty CSS lib for the component (shared with JS lib)
- `options.html`: whether to create a default HTML file for the component
- `options.slingmodel`: whether to create a sling model for the component
    - Class name is derived from converting "name" prop above to camel case (e.g. "google-maps" -> `GoogleMaps`/`GoogleMapsImpl`)
    - Fields are derived from dialog properties (see below)
- `options.properties`: properties to create in standard dialog for this component. If empty, no standard dialog will be created. This sample includes one of every possible sling:resourceType
- `options.properties-shared`: properties to create in shared dialog for this component. If empty, no shared dialog will be created
- `options.properties-global`: properties to create in global dialog for this component. If empty, no global dialog will be created

Step 3: In your terminal, navigate to the `hs2-aem-base` folder and execute the following command.

```sh
$ java -jar <jarfile> <arg1>
```

- `jarfile`: full path to `component-generator-N.N.jar` file (replacing `N.N` with the applicable numbers)
- `arg1`: full path to `data-config.json` file

Example:
```sh
$ java -jar scripts/compgen/component-generator-1.0.jar scripts/compgen/data-config.json
```

Retrieving Data for Composite Multifields:
```
<div data-sly-list="${model.multifield}">
   ${item} <!-- item0, item1, ... -->
</div>
```
