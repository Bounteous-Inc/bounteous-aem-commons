# AEM Dev/Ops Runbook Template by Bounteous (previously HS2 Solutions)

This is a template to aid in creation of a Dev/Ops Runbook for an AEM platform.

This template was first released as part of "Adobe IMMERSE 2018: The Model Dev/Ops Runbook - Giving Managed Services the Details They Need."

The purpose of a dev/ops runbook is to provide a complete set of procedures and detailed information to help effectively
manage the hosted Adobe AEM Instance.  This information is designed to provide context to those who do not have intimate
knowledge of the environment, but need to be able to quickly and efficiently troubleshoot and/or resolve potential
issues that may arise, such as the Adobe NOC.

Core Tenets:
- Content organization
- Appropriate level of detail – nothing more, nothing less
- Ease of creation and maintenance

A runbook following this template has been (unofficially) labeled by Adobe Managed Services as a "model runbook." 

## Contents

Runbook (largely a copy of the template).
